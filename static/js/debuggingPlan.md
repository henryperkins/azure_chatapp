### Debugging Plan for Undefined Value in `knowledgeBaseComponent.js`

1. **Identify the Error Location**:
   - The error occurs at `knowledgeBaseComponent.js:280:16`, specifically when trying to read a property using `.startsWith` on an undefined value.

2. **Trace the Call Stack**:
   - The call stack indicates that the error originates from the `initialize` method of `KnowledgeBaseComponentWithDestroy` at line 279.
   - This method is called by `_initKbc` in `projectDetailsComponent.js` at line 571.

3. **Data Flow Mapping**:
   - **ProjectDetailsComponent** calls `_initKbc`, which initializes the `KnowledgeBaseComponent`.
   - The `KnowledgeBaseComponent` is expected to receive data from the `ProjectManager` through its dependencies.

4. **Identify Upstream Dependencies**:
   - Check how `projectManager` is being passed to `KnowledgeBaseComponent`.
   - Verify the data being passed from `ProjectDetailsComponent` to `KnowledgeBaseComponent` during initialization.

5. **Assumptions to Verify**:
   - **Assumption 1**: The `projectManager` is correctly instantiated and passed to `KnowledgeBaseComponent`.
     - Verify in `projectDetailsComponent.js` that `projectManager` is not null or undefined before passing it.
   - **Assumption 2**: The data structure expected by `KnowledgeBaseComponent.initialize` is correctly formed.
     - Check the expected input for `initialize` and ensure that the data being passed matches this structure.
   - **Assumption 3**: The `initialize` method is called at the correct lifecycle stage.
     - Ensure that the `initialize` method is not called before the necessary data is available.

6. **Follow-Up Questions**:
   - In `knowledgeBaseComponent.js`, can you provide the implementation of the `initialize` method (lines 250-310) to see how the data is being processed?
   - In `projectDetailsComponent.js`, what is the exact implementation of `_initKbc` (lines 570-590) and how is it invoking `KnowledgeBaseComponent`?
   - In `projectManager.js`, how is the `projectManager` instance being created and what data does it hold that is passed to `KnowledgeBaseComponent`?
   - Are there any lifecycle events or conditions that might affect the availability of the data being passed to `KnowledgeBaseComponent`?
