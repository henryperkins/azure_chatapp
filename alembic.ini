# Alembic Migration Configuration File (alembic.ini)
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# This INI configures Alembic's migration infrastructure for this project.
# It defines migration script locations, code generation options, logging, and other behaviors.
#
# Project Customizations & Best Practices:
# - Migration scripts are stored in the 'alembic' directory, with versioned subfolders.
# - By default, the true SQLAlchemy URL is injected at runtime via alembic/env.py; the value below is a placeholder.
# - System path is set to current working directory for model import resolvability.
# - Logging configuration is established for both Alembic and SQLAlchemy engine subsystems.
# - Supports out-of-the-box integration with formatting/linting post-write hooks for code quality.
# - The version_path_separator is set to 'os' for robust cross-platform operation.
#
# Normally modified only by maintainers. For code integration details, see 'alembic/env.py'.

[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are run
# on newly generated revision scripts.  See the documentation for further
# detail and examples

# format using "black" - use the console_scripts runner, against the "black" entrypoint
# hooks = black
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME

# lint with attempts to fix using "ruff" - use the exec runner, execute a binary
# hooks = ruff
# ruff.type = exec
# ruff.executable = %(here)s/.venv/bin/ruff
# ruff.options = --fix REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
