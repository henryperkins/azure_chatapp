# Notification System Removed

The notification system has been completely removed from the application to simplify the codebase. This includes:

- All UI notification banners
- Notification utility functions
- Error reporting and monitoring
- Debug and trace utilities
- Backend logging endpoints

## Migration Notes

When working with existing code:

1. Direct DOM manipulation should be done through the `domAPI` utility
2. For error handling, use standard try/catch blocks without notification calls
3. For debugging, use standard browser dev tools
4. For API calls, use the `apiClient` directly without wrappers
5. For event handlers, register them directly with `eventHandlers.trackListener`

## Architecture Changes

The following components have been removed:

1. **notify.js** - Core notification utility
2. **notification-handler.js** - UI notification banners
3. **log_notification.py** - Backend logging endpoint
4. **notifications-helpers.js** - Debug and API wrapping utilities
5. **backendLogger.js** - Backend logging module
6. **sentry-init.js** - Error tracking and monitoring

Refer to the updated custominstructions.md for current code standards.
