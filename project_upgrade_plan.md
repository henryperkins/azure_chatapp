# Comprehensive Upgrade Plan: Aligning Existing Implementation with "Projects Plan"

Below is a fully consolidated and expanded document detailing the complete strategy to upgrade the current project implementation to match the “projects-plan.md” specification, including an emphasis on how projects and chats (conversations) should interact.

---

## 1. Existing Implementation Overview

1. **Project**  
   - Represents user-specific workspaces.  
   - Stored in the "projects" table with fields like id (UUID), name, goals, pinned, archived, etc.  
   - Basic routes in project_routes.py for create/update/list.  

2. **Chat**  
   - Named as "Chat", bridging to one or more projects with a many-to-many table "chat_projects".  
   - A "Chat" is effectively a conversation, holding messages.  

3. **Message**  
   - Tied to Chat, with a role ("user", "assistant", "system"), plus content.  

4. **Project File**  
   - "ProjectFile" stores and links local or S3 file references to a single project.  

5. **knowledgebase_service.py**  
   - Handles local file uploads (ProjectFile creation).  

6. **file_upload.py**  
   - Uploads to Azure OpenAI’s /files endpoints for text files up to 1 MB.  

Overall, we have partial coverage for project CRUD, knowledge base, and chat management, though some advanced requirements from “projects-plan.md” aren’t fully addressed.

---

## 2. Summarizing "projects-plan.md"

The plan calls for:
1. **Projects**: Each project is a workspace with name, description, goals, pinned, archived, custom instructions, token usage, and knowledge base documents.  
2. **Knowledge Base**: Allows multiple file types up to 30MB, supporting the entire project’s context.  
3. **Conversations**: Each project can have multiple conversations, each conversation with a series of messages referencing the project’s knowledge base.  
4. **Artifacts**: A separate model for user- or AI-generated content (code, docs, images).  
5. **Detailed Requirements**: Performance, scale, reliability, security constraints, plus endpoints for all the above.  
6. **Database Schema**: Lays out proposed tables (projects, conversations, messages, files, project_files, artifacts), with each conversation referencing one project.  
7. **Development Phases**: Implementation timeline with recommended tasks (backend + frontend).

## 3. Core Differences and Needed Upgrades

1. **Projects**  
   - The new plan specifies additional fields (e.g., description, metadata, is_default) and clarifies usage of pinned/archived.  
   - We’ll need to refine the schema to align with the plan’s “projects” structure.  

2. **Conversations**  
   - The plan uses “conversations” that are children of a single project (one-to-many).  
   - Our current code uses “Chat” with a many-to-many link to projects.  
   - We should unify or rename “Chat” → “Conversation,” add a direct `project_id` reference, and drop the “chat_projects” bridging table.  

3. **Messages**  
   - Already close to the plan. Each message references the conversation, storing roles (user/assistant/system), content, and metadata.  
   - We may rename references from chat_id to conversation_id and do a migration.  

4. **Knowledge Base**  
   - The plan combines “files” + “project_files” for knowledge base management.  
   - We can unify or expand our existing “ProjectFile” approach to handle more file types (PDF, DOCX, etc.) and the 30MB limit.  
   - We also have “file_upload.py” dealing with Azure 1MB text files. Potentially unify or keep distinct.  

5. **Artifacts**  
   - No official model in the current code. The plan wants a table for storing code, documents, or images generated by the AI.  

6. **Routing**  
   - The plan suggests a nested structure: /api/projects/{project_id}/conversations, /files, /artifacts, etc.  
   - Our code currently has separate routes for /conversations, /files, etc. We’ll unify them under the project context.

## 4. Detailed Upgrade Steps

### 4.1 Database Schema Overhaul

1. **Projects Table**  
   - Add columns:  
     - description (Text, nullable)  
     - is_default (Boolean, default False)  
     - metadata (JSONB)  
     - updated_at with onupdate=NOW()  
   - Ensure pinned and archived fields match the plan’s usage defaults (False).  
   - Keep or rename token_usage, max_tokens.  
   - Possibly rename “goals” to “goals” or “objectives” to match plan.

2. **Renaming “Chat” → “Conversation”**  
   - Create an Alembic migration to rename the table “chats” to “conversations,” dropping the many-to-many table “chat_projects.”  
   - Replace the foreign key references plus chat_id → conversation_id if necessary.  
   - Add a column `project_id` (UUID references “projects.id”) for each conversation.  
   - Migrate existing data:  
     - If a chat was linked to multiple projects, decide which project it belongs to or replicate the chat.  

3. **Messages**  
   - Potentially rename chat_id to conversation_id in “messages.”  
   - If we rename “chats” to “conversations,” ensure references in “messages” are updated.  

4. **Files** / **project_files**  
   - The plan suggests “files” plus “project_files” if we want multiple projects referencing a single file.  
   - Alternatively, keep “project_files” as is but add columns:  
     - file_size, file_type, metadata.  
   - Increase or confirm 30MB upload limit.  

5. **Artifacts**  
   - Create an “artifacts” table with columns:  
     - id (UUID), project_id (UUID), conversation_id (UUID), name, content_type, content (Text), created_at, metadata (JSONB).  
   - Provide migrations for existing code if relevant or start fresh.  

### 4.2 Adjusting Services and Routes

1. **Project Routes**  
   - Extend project_routes.py to handle new fields: description, custom_instructions, etc.  
   - Provide new routes for toggling pinned, archived, default, etc.  
   - Possibly break out custom instructions into a dedicated endpoint.  

2. **Conversation (Chat) Routes**  
   - Convert existing chat endpoints in chat.py to a nested route approach:  
     - GET/POST: /api/projects/{project_id}/conversations  
     - GET/PATCH/DELETE: /api/projects/{project_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}  
   - Deprecate or remove /chat endpoints that do not reference a project.  

3. **Knowledge Base**  
   - Unify knowledgebase_service.py with file_upload.py if possible, or keep them specialized.  
   - Provide an endpoint /api/projects/{project_id}/files with support for PDF, DOCX, etc., up to 30MB.  

4. **Artifacts**  
   - Implement routes:  
     - /api/projects/{project_id}/artifacts (POST, GET)  
     - /api/projects/{project_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id} (GET, DELETE)  
   - Possibly link an artifact to a conversation if relevant, or store them only at the project level.  

### 4.3 Business Logic Updates

1. **Enforce Single Project-Conversation Relationship**  
   - Whenever we create a conversation, we require a project_id.  
   - Any message within that conversation inherits context from the associated project’s knowledge base.  

2. **Token Usage**  
   - The plan emphasizes up to 200,000 tokens per project.  
   - We can track token usage in “project.token_usage,” incrementing usage whenever we add files or process messages.  

3. **Custom Instructions**  
   - Expand usage so that every conversation under a project automatically references the project’s custom instructions.  
   - Possibly incorporate them in openai_chat calls or an Azure equivalent.  

4. **File Size and Type Enforcement**  
   - Our knowledgebase_service or file_upload logic must check the 30MB limit, plus allowed file types matching the plan (PDF, DOCX, etc.).  

5. **Artifacts Flow**  
   - After generating code or text from the AI, store it in the artifacts table.  
   - Associate the artifact with a specific project, optionally referencing a conversation for context.  

### 4.4 Frontend (If Migrating to a React Single-Page App)

The plan calls for a React + Tailwind approach. If we decide to implement that:
1. **React Setup**  
   - Provide components for project creation, listing, editing.  
   - Provide a nested route for conversations (React Router) under each project.  
   - Provide knowledge base (files) manager and custom instructions editor.  
2. **Global State**  
   - Possibly store currentProjectId, plus caching of project data, conversations, messages.  
3. **Integration**  
   - Test thoroughly with the new routes to ensure uploads, artifact storage, and conversation flows are correct.

## 5. Timeline Estimate

(Reflecting the “phased” approach in “projects-plan.md” and adjusting for the existing codebase)

**Phase 1 (1–2 Weeks)**  
- Database migrations for new/renamed fields and tables.  
- Overhaul of routes to adopt nested project-based structure.  
- Basic testing to ensure old data is preserved or properly migrated.

**Phase 2 (1–2 Weeks)**  
- Implement updated knowledge base logic for 30MB files.  
- Integrate custom instructions directly in chat or openai_chat calls.  
- Add artifact handling plus associated routes.

**Phase 3 (1–2 Weeks)**  
- If front-end is advanced, unify a React-based architecture.  
- Thoroughly test the entire system for pinned projects, archived projects, file uploads, artifact creation, etc.

**Phase 4**  
- Final performance optimizations, security enhancements, leftover tasks.

## 6. Projects-Chats (Conversations) Integration (Detailed Explanation)

Currently, “Chat” can link to multiple projects via “chat_projects.” The new plan wants one conversation per project. Steps to unify:

1. **Remove “chat_projects”**  
   - Create a new column in “chats” → “project_id.”  
2. **Rename “chats”**  
   - Possibly rename the table to “conversations,” with “conversation_id.”  
3. **Modify Code References**  
   - In chat.py, instead of referencing multiple projects, we accept a single `project_id`. We then store that in the conversation record.  
   - Adjust queries and route paths accordingly (e.g., /api/projects/{project_id}/conversations).  

As a result, each conversation is tightly scoped to a single project, inheriting that project’s knowledge base, instructions, pinned state, etc.

## 7. Conclusion

By extending our schema, renaming “Chat” to “Conversation,” merging or rewriting file management, and introducing artifacts, we bring the current codebase into alignment with the robust feature set detailed in “projects-plan.md.” The final system will:

1. Provide a tailored project “workspace” for each user scenario.  
2. Maintain consistent AI context, custom instructions, and knowledge base usage within each project.  
3. Optimize conversation flows, ensuring clarity in parent-project relationships.  
4. Accommodate advanced artifact storage and memory usage tracking.

This thoroughly fulfills the user’s request for a complete plan that explains how to update the existing system to the new specification, including explicit detail on how projects and conversations interrelate.
