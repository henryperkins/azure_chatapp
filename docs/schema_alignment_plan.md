# Plan to Resolve Type Mismatches for `timestamp without time zone`

## Step 1: Analyze the Problem
- **Objective**: Ensure that the database schema and ORM definitions are consistent for `timestamp without time zone`.
- **Details**:
  - The validation logic in `db.py` checks for type mismatches and attempts to align them.
  - The mismatches are logged as warnings, but the alignment logic may not fully resolve them.

## Step 2: Gather Context
- **Files to Investigate**:
  - `db.py`: Contains the schema validation and alignment logic.
  - `scripts/`: May contain SQL scripts for schema updates.
  - `models/`: Contains ORM definitions for the database tables.
- **Tools**:
  - Use `read_file` to inspect relevant files for ORM definitions and schema alignment logic.
  - Use `search_files` to locate specific timestamp definitions in ORM models and database scripts.

## Step 3: Identify Root Cause
- Compare the database schema definitions (retrieved via `information_schema`) with ORM model definitions.
- Check for discrepancies in:
  - Column types (`timestamp without time zone` vs `timestamp with time zone`).
  - Default values.
  - Nullable constraints.

## Step 4: Propose Fixes
- Update the database schema to match ORM definitions using SQL ALTER statements.
- Update ORM definitions if necessary to align with the database schema.
- Modify the schema alignment logic in `db.py` to handle precision differences for timestamps.

## Step 5: Implement Fixes
- Add SQL ALTER statements to the schema alignment logic in `db.py` for mismatched columns.
- Update ORM definitions in `models/` to ensure consistency.

## Step 6: Test and Validate
- Run schema validation again to confirm that all mismatches are resolved.
- Test database operations to ensure no regressions.

## Step 7: Document Changes
- Update documentation in `docs/` to reflect schema changes.
