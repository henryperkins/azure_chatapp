# Phase-2 Issue 2.3 – UI & Conversation State Centralization

**Owner**: `@frontend-team`

**Goal**: Remove scattered local state variables in components and consolidate into services (projectContextService, ConversationManager, uiStateService).

## Tasks
1. Audit `projectId`, `conversationId`, UI flags in all components.
2. Add `static/js/uiStateService.js` (new service) – central store for ephemeral UI flags (✅ scaffolded in plan).
3. Refactor components to read/write via services – no local mutable module-level state.
4. Unit tests for UIStateService.

## Definition of Done
• No `let` / mutable state at module scope in components.  
• All state reads/writes routed through services.  
• Jest tests confirm state consistency.
