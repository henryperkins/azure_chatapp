# UI/UX Analysis – Mobile Responsiveness, Modals, Typography  
*(Date: 2024-06-09 … commit SHA: [pending])*

## 1. Mobile Responsiveness

### 1.1 Layout audit (320–480 px)
- **Project List & Details:** Layouts generally stack vertically as expected. On iPhone SE (320px) and Pixel 5 (393px), main containers (e.g., `.project-list`, `.project-card`, `.modal-box`) adapt to screen width.
- **Sidebar:** On mobile, sidebar overlays content and is hidden by default. The width is set to 80vw/max-w-xs, which is appropriate.
- **Chat UI:** Chat input and message containers remain usable, but message bubbles can become cramped at 320px.
- **Modals:** Modal dialogs expand to full width on ≤480px, using the `.modal-box` override.

### 1.2 Overflow & alignment findings
- **Horizontal Overflow:** Some long project/file names or chat messages can cause horizontal scrolling in `.chat-message-container` and `.project-card`. The use of `overflow-x-auto` mitigates this, but truncation/ellipsis is not always consistent.
- **Alignment:** Button groups and tab bars occasionally wrap awkwardly on very narrow screens, especially when there are multiple actions (e.g., project actions, modal footers).
- **Tables/Lists:** Data tables and file lists are horizontally scrollable, but the scroll indicator is subtle.

### 1.3 Touch-target assessment
- **Buttons:** Most interactive elements (buttons, tabs, file actions) meet the 44x44px minimum tap target, enforced via Tailwind utilities and custom CSS.
- **Icons:** Some icon-only buttons (e.g., close, minimize) are visually small but have sufficient hit area due to padding.
- **File preview remove buttons and sidebar actions** are compliant.
- **Potential Issues:** Some links (e.g., "Need an account? Register") and inline actions may be smaller than ideal.

### 1.4 Actionable recommendations
- • Ensure all text fields and links (not just buttons) meet the 44x44px tap target, especially in modals and sidebars.
- • Add `text-ellipsis` and `truncate` utilities to all potentially long text fields (project names, file names, chat messages).
- • Consider increasing padding/margin for stacked button groups on mobile to prevent accidental taps.
- • Make horizontal scroll indicators more visible for overflow areas.

## 2. Modal Functionality

### 2.1 Interaction & closing patterns
- **Open/Close:** Modals can be opened via buttons and closed via close buttons, backdrop click, or Esc key. Focus trap is implemented for accessibility.
- **Multiple Modals:** Only one modal is visible at a time; stacking is prevented.
- **Form Submission:** Forms inside modals use loading states and disable submit buttons during processing.

### 2.2 Small-screen adaptability
- **Width:** On ≤480px, `.modal-box` expands to 100vw/100vh, with padding and scrollable content.
- **Action Buttons:** Modal actions are stacked vertically on small screens for easier access.
- **Overflow:** Content is scrollable within the modal, but very long forms (e.g., knowledge base settings) may still require more visible scroll cues.

### 2.3 Visual-hierarchy & accessibility
- **Focus Management:** Focus is trapped within the modal; first element is focused on open.
- **Contrast:** Modal backgrounds and text meet WCAG AA contrast ratios in both light and dark themes.
- **Labels:** All form fields have associated labels; required fields are marked.
- **ARIA:** Modals use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`, with appropriate `aria-labelledby`.

### 2.4 Improvement steps
- • Add more visible focus outlines for all modal action buttons and links.
- • Ensure all modals have a visible title and that `aria-labelledby` points to it.
- • For long modals, add a shadow or gradient at the bottom/top to indicate scrollability.
- • Review all close/cancel buttons for consistent placement and labeling.

## 3. Typography

### 3.1 Current fonts / sizes / line-height
- **Font:** Uses system UI font stack via Tailwind's `font-sans`.
- **Base Size:** 1rem (16px) for body; headings scale up (e.g., `.text-lg`, `.text-xl`).
- **Line Height:** Generally 1.5–1.55 for body text; headings are tighter.
- **Chat Bubbles:** Use `.text-base` or `.text-sm` depending on context.

### 3.2 Hierarchy consistency
- **Headings:** Consistent use of `.text-lg`, `.text-xl`, `.font-semibold` for section titles.
- **Subheadings:** Sometimes missing or inconsistent in modals and tab panels.
- **Body Text:** Occasional overuse of `.text-xs` for important info, which can reduce readability on mobile.

### 3.3 Legibility issues
- **Small Text:** Some helper text, error messages, and labels use `.text-xs`, which may be too small on mobile.
- **Color Contrast:** Sufficient in both themes, but secondary text (`text-base-content/60`) can be faint on some backgrounds.
- **Truncation:** Long text in project/file names may be truncated, but not always with a tooltip for full value.

### 3.4 Enhancement suggestions
- • Avoid `.text-xs` for essential information; use `.text-sm` minimum on mobile.
- • Add tooltips or accessible labels for truncated text.
- • Ensure all headings use semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for screen readers.
- • Review line-height for dense lists and tables to improve scan-ability.

## 4. Prioritised Fix List (high → low)
1. **Ensure all interactive elements (including links) meet 44x44px tap target on mobile.**
2. **Improve horizontal overflow handling and add visible scroll indicators for all scrollable areas.**
3. **Increase minimum font size for helper/error text to `.text-sm` on mobile.**
4. Add tooltips for truncated text fields (project/file names, chat titles).
5. Add visual cues (shadow/gradient) for scrollable modal content.
6. Review and standardize modal close/cancel button placement and ARIA labeling.
