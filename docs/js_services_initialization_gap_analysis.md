# Static JS / Services / Initialization – Gap Analysis

Date: 2025-06-15

This document captures a **quick architecture & gap review** of the four key
front-end directories that power the web UI:

* `static/js` – feature modules.
* `static/js/utils` – generic, stateless helper utilities used throughout the
  code base.
* `static/services` – emerging *service* layer that provides thin, pure facades
  over shared state or remote APIs.
* `static/js/initialization` – the new multi-phase bootstrap system that
  orchestrates dependency injection and application start-up.

The analysis was performed by scanning the code base only – no runtime traces
were collected.  It therefore focuses on **structural** and **consistency**
issues that can be detected statically.

## 1. Directory Purpose & Current Health

| Area | Purpose (as implemented) | Condition |
|------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **`static/js`** | Feature modules (chat, KB, projects…), UI components.  Strict DI guard-rails are largely in place. | Healthy, but *huge* – >70 factories with mixed maturity levels. |
| **`static/js/utils`** | Low-level, side-effect-free helpers (`apiClient`, `browserService`, `domAPI`, etc.).  Provide building blocks consumed by services & feature modules. | Good overall quality, but ownership overlaps with `static/services`, and some files still use small global checks (`typeof window`). |
| **`static/services`** | Very small, modern façade layer (`authenticationService`, `eventService`, `projectAPIService`, …).  Pure functions, no side-effects at module scope. | Healthy but **incomplete** and **overlapping** with older utils. |
| **`static/js/initialization`** | Refactored 5-phase bootstrap (`bootstrapCore`, `serviceInit`, `coreInit`, `authInit`, `uiInit`, etc.).  Splits monolith into <200 line files. | Generally solid, but **registration coverage is uneven** and **legacy shims still leak in**. |

---

## 2. Key Strengths Observed

1. **Factory-only exports & explicit DI** – the vast majority of modules follow the 2025 guard-rails (no singletons, `cleanup()` present, dependency validation at top).
2. **Unified Event Bus** – `static/services/eventService.js` provides a single `EventTarget` wrapper that can fully replace historical `AppBus` / `AuthBus` constructs.
3. **Multi-phase Bootstrap** – the `initialization` folder cleanly separates concerns, making the start-up sequence readable and testable.
4. **Error Handling Discipline** – nearly every factory has `_logInfo` / `_logError` helpers that wrap logger calls inside `try/catch` to avoid recursive failures.
5. **Reusable Utility Layer** – `static/js/utils` houses well-documented, side-effect-free helpers (`apiClient`, `domAPI`, `browserService`) that can be composed by both services _and_ feature modules.

These give the code base a strong foundation to iterate on.

---

## 3. Gaps & Inconsistencies (Highest → Lowest Impact)

### 3.1 Incomplete Migration to the Unified Event Bus *(High)*

* Several feature modules still reference legacy globals `AppBus`, `AuthBus` or
  fallback to `document` listeners (e.g. `knowledgeBaseComponent.js`,
  `chatExtensions.js`).
* Risk: duplicated listeners, inconsistent event ordering, memory leaks.

**Action**  
Provide thin shims during bootstrap (already easy via `eventService.getAuthBus()`)
and schedule removal of all direct `AuthBus` / `AppBus` look-ups.

---

### 3.2 Directory Overlap Between *services* and *utils* *(High)*

* There is conceptual duplication **at two layers**:
  * **Domain-level** – `static/services/projectAPIService.js` overlaps with
    logic still living in `static/js/projectManager.js` &
    `projectDataCoordinator.js`.
  * **Infrastructure-level** – generic helpers like
    `static/js/utils/apiClient.js` and the specialised
    `static/services/*APIService.js` files both wrap `fetch`, error handling,
    and CSRF token logic.

This blurs ownership and causes developers to ask “Which path should I
import?”

**Action**  
Document and enforce a **dependency hierarchy**:

```
utils  →  services  →  feature modules
```

* **utils** – pure, stateless helpers with zero business knowledge.
* **services** – compose utils; expose domain-aware operations.
* **feature modules** – UI & complex behaviour that depend on services.

Add an ESLint rule (`no-upward-import`) so lower tiers cannot import from upper
tiers.

---

### 3.3 Multiple *App Initializers* in the Repo *(Medium)*

* `static/js/init/appInitializer.js` is a **legacy test stub** while
  `static/js/initialization/appInitializer.js` is the real orchestrator.
* Both export `createAppInitializer`, causing ambiguous imports.

**Action**  
Add an ESLint import-path rule or move the stub under
`static/js/__test_stubs__/` to avoid accidental production usage.

---

### 3.4 Service Registration Coverage Gaps *(Medium)*

* `tokenStatsManagerProxy` is registered at bootstrap, but the **real**
  `tokenStatsManager` is only wired in `uiInit`.  Until that phase completes
  any advanced methods (other than `setInputTokenCount`) silently queue.
* `knowledgeBaseReadinessService` is created in `serviceInit`, yet several KB
  modules perform their own readiness checks, bypassing the service.
* `projectContextService` is created, but older UI panels still read project
  state directly from `appModule.state`.

**Action**  
Audit each feature initialiser to ensure the façade services are *actually* the
single consumption point.  Add runtime warnings when direct state access is
detected.

---

### 3.5 Test Coverage *(Medium)*

* Only two Jest tests exist in `static/js/__tests__/` – covering auth storage and token-stats DI.
* No tests for the new service layer or bootstrap phases.

**Action**  
Introduce phase-specific unit tests (e.g. `serviceInit.registerBasicServices`)
and integration test the whole `initializeApp()` sequence with mocked
factories.

---

### 3.6 Side-effect Free Guarantee Occasionally Broken *(Low)*

* `static/js/modalManager.js` still executes a global logger lookup at module
  load (`globalThis.DependencySystem?.modules?.get('logger')`).
* A few modules check `typeof window !== 'undefined'` at top scope.

These are *soft* violations but contradict the “no globals” rule.

**Action**  
Move such look-ups inside the factory or behind an injected `browserService`.

---

### 3.7 Cleanup Contract Not Uniform *(Low)*

* Some factories expose `cleanup()` that is a no-op; others omit it entirely
  (e.g. a handful of utils in `static/js/utils`).
* During bootstrap rollback (see `appInitializer`), phases assume every module
  supports `cleanup()`.

**Action**  
Add a tiny ESLint rule (`require-cleanup-export`) to enforce presence of the
method even if empty.

---

## 4. Quick Wins

1. Add a TSCONFIG & enable **JSDoc @typedef** checks – many factories already
   include rich JSDoc; we can catch missing deps early.
2. Configure **ESLint import/no-duplicates** to flag the two `appInitializer`
   paths.
3. Write a **cypress smoke test** that boots the app, opens the console and
   asserts that no “✖ Phase failed” log is emitted.

---

## 5. Roadmap Proposal (90 day)

| Week | Focus | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Finalise EventBus migration | All `AuthBus` / `AppBus` references removed. |
| 3-4 | Service vs. util audit | Clear ownership doc, dead code deleted. |
| 5-6 | Expand Jest suite | ≥ 60% statement coverage for `static/services` & bootstrap. |
| 7-8 | Cleanup uniformity | Lint rule merged; CI fails on missing `cleanup()`. |
| 9-10 | Legacy stub relocation | `init/appInitializer.js` moved under test fixtures folder; import rule in place. |
| 11-12 | Documentation & scorecard | Publish ADR on front-end DI strategy. |

---

## 6. Conclusion

The modernisation effort is **well on its way** – the multi-phase bootstrap and
service façade concepts are sound.  The remaining work is mostly *consistency*
and *cleanup*: unify the event bus, finalise the service layer migration, and
strengthen automated tests so regressions are caught early.

## 4. Deep-Dive: `static/js/utils`

After an additional code-wide scan the utility layer emerged as the **largest
remaining risk surface**.  Key points:

1. **Hidden Global Fallbacks** – Several utils (`apiClient.js`,
   `globalUtils.js`, `authApiService.js`) read from
   `globalThis.DependencySystem`, bypassing DI and making tests pass by
   accident.  Breaks SSR and erodes modularity.
2. **Duplicate Local-Storage Wrappers** – `storageService.js` and
   `browserService.js` both encapsulate `localStorage` with slightly different
   semantics (error swallowing vs. re-throw).
3. **Missing `cleanup()` in `pullToRefresh.js`** – Touch listeners remain after
   module teardown, conflicting with SPA navigation & jest tests.
4. **Over-engineered `domReadinessService.js` (600 LOC)** – Reimplements native
   `DOMContentLoaded`/`load` behaviour; now redundant given staged bootstrap.
5. **Business Rules Creep** – `globalUtils.js` mixes low-level helpers with
   project-specific URL heuristics; violates single-responsibility.
6. **Zero Jest Coverage** – No automated tests for foundational utils.

### Immediate Fixes

* Add ESLint rule `no-global-ds-in-utils`.
* Extract a single `storageService`; let `browserService` delegate.
* Export `cleanup()` from `pullToRefresh.js` (detach listeners).
* Decompose `domReadinessService.js` or delete once phased bootstrap proves
  stable.
* Unit tests for `apiClient`, `domAPI`, `browserService`.

## 5. Updated Quick Wins

1. `tsconfig.json` + JSDoc type-checking.
2. ESLint rules: `import/no-duplicates`, `no-global-ds-in-utils`,
   `require-cleanup-export`.
3. Detachable pull-to-refresh listeners.
4. Storage wrapper consolidation.
5. Jest suites for core utils.
6. Code-split legacy polyfills via dynamic `import()`.

---

## 6. Revised 90-Day Roadmap

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | EventBus finalisation | Legacy buses removed, lint green |
| 2 | Global-DS lint | CI fails on globals in utils |
| 3-4 | Storage unification | Single `storageService` |
| 5-6 | Utils test suite | ≥ 80 % coverage on apiClient/domAPI/browserService |
| 7 | Pull-to-refresh + polyfill | Cleanup & code-split merged |
| 8-9 | Service ↔ utils ADR | Dependency hierarchy documented & linted |
| 10-12 | Cleanup uniformity | `cleanup()` rule enforced; docs updated |

---

## 7. Conclusion (v2)

The foundation is solid, but the **utility layer hides shortcuts** (globals,
duplicate storage, absent cleanup) that threaten DI guarantees.  Fixing these
alongside previously identified gaps will lock in the architecture’s
robustness and ease future TypeScript adoption.
